KCometen3 is a popular KDE screensaver hosted on KDE-look.org. QCometen3
is a port of it to to Qt4. It doesn't depend on any KDE version, but
should work in both KDE3 and KDE4. With some tinkering, it may work in
Xscreensaver and gnome-screensaver too.

Unfortunately, QCometen3 doesn't come with a setup dialog. However, if
you used KCometen3 before, QCometen3 can read its config files. If not,
you'll have to create a config file in ~/.config/QCometen3.conf manually.
(See default values at the bottom of the README.)

KCometen3 is by Peter Mueller <pmueller@cs.tu-berlin.de>. It was ported
to Qt4 by Tomi Belan <tomi.belan@gmail.com>.

To build and install QCometen3:
(You won't need any KDE libs, Qt4 is enough.)
$ qmake (regenerates Makefile from qcometen3.pro; optional)
$ make
$ install -p -m 755 qcometen3 /usr/bin/qcometen3
KDE3: $ install -p -m 644 kde3-qcometen3.desktop /usr/share/applnk/System/ScreenSavers/qcometen3.desktop
KDE4: $ install -p -m 644 kde4-qcometen3.desktop /usr/share/kde4/services/ScreenSavers/qcometen3.desktop
